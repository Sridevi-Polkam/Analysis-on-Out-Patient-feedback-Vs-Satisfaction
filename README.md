# **Analysis-on-Out-Patient-feedback-Vs-Satisfaction**

## **üìå Problem Statement**
Out-patient satisfaction is a critical quality metric at Lotus Hospitals, data-driven way to understand and improve out-patient (OP) satisfaction. Using Net Promoter Score (NPS) feedback and OP footfall records, the goal is to quantify current satisfaction levels, identify the service drivers (e.g., appointment experience, reception, consultation, labs, radiology, facilities, parking/security) that most influence overall satisfaction, and translate those insights into actionable recommendations for operations.
